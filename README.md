# Insipiration for trying out :-Automation-Daily-Whatspp-mesagge-sender-to-Brother

Recently moved leaving my home country to far off place , with time difference being connected with loved ones is important.
Created a python script with Automator ( Mac feature just like Task scheduler in windows) to run the script evrday at morning 8:0 clock to send Goodmornign Text to my Brother .


Used Twilio Sandbox and registered both sender and receiver phone number to allow sending and receiving messages through Twilio Whatsap Sandbox
